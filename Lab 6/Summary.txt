1st Approach:
############

In this analysis, we trained and evaluated multiple regression models to predict the **PRICE** of houses based on **PROPERTYSQFT** (square footage) from the **NY House Dataset**. The key steps and components of the analysis are as follows:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - The dataset was loaded and cleaned to ensure that the relevant columns (such as **PRICE** and **PROPERTYSQFT**) contained numeric data. We removed any non-numeric characters from the columns.
   - Missing or zero values were filtered out to ensure the dataset only included valid entries.
   - The **PRICE** and **PROPERTYSQFT** columns were selected for further analysis.

2. **Data Normalization**:
   - Both **PRICE** and **PROPERTYSQFT** were normalized using a min-max scaling technique to ensure all numeric features are on the same scale. This helps improve the performance of some machine learning models like **SVM** and **k-NN**.

3. **Model Training**:
   We trained **six regression models** on the dataset:
   - **Linear Regression**: A simple linear regression model was trained to predict **PRICE** from **PROPERTYSQFT**.
   - **Random Forest**: A decision tree-based ensemble method was used to model the relationship between **PROPERTYSQFT** and **PRICE**.
   - **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**: A non-parametric method was used to predict **PRICE** by looking at the 5 nearest neighbors in the training data.
   - **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**:
     - **Linear SVM**: A linear kernel SVM model was trained.
     - **Radial SVM**: A radial kernel SVM was used to capture non-linear relationships between **PROPERTYSQFT** and **PRICE**.
     - **Tuned Radial SVM**: A radial kernel SVM with hyperparameter tuning was performed to find the optimal values for the **gamma** and **cost** parameters.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**, **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**, and **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** were calculated for each model to assess its performance.
   - We compared the performance of the models based on these error metrics to see which model performed best.

5. **Visualizations**:
   Several visualizations were created to aid in understanding the model predictions and the relationships between variables:
   - **Scatter plots** to visualize the relationships between **PROPERTYSQFT** and **PRICE**.
   - **Logarithmic plots** to assess the distribution and correlation between the variables.
   - **Predicted vs Actual** plots for each model to visually compare the predictions with the true values.
   - **Model-specific plots** for each of the regression models (**Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, **k-NN**, and **SVM**) to showcase how well they fit the data.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Random Forest** and **Tuned Radial SVM** were the most effective models, showing the best performance in terms of **MAE**, **MSE**, and **RMSE**.
- **Linear Regression** and **k-NN** showed less accurate predictions, with **k-NN** being sensitive to feature scaling.
- **Visualizations** such as **Predicted vs Actual** plots helped in identifying how well the models fit the data and provided insights into their predictive capabilities.

This comprehensive analysis provides a detailed evaluation of different regression models applied to real estate data and highlights how well these models generalize for predicting property prices based on square footage.


2nd Approach:
#############

1. **Objective**  
We trained and evaluated three regression models to predict house prices (log-transformed) based on square footage (log-transformed) using the NY House Dataset, comparing their performance using MAE, MSE, and RMSE.

2. **Steps Performed**  
**Data Preparation**  
Dataset Used: NY-House-Dataset.csv  

- **Cleaning**: Removed an outlier (PROPERTYSQFT = 2184.207862).  
- **Transformations**:  
    - Applied log10 to both PRICE and PROPERTYSQFT to handle skewness and improve model fitting.  

**Train-Test Split**:  
- 75% training, 25% testing (randomized with set.seed(123) for reproducibility).  

**Models Trained & Evaluated**  
- **Linear Regression (LM)**:  
    - Simple linear model (log_PRICE ~ log_PROPERTYSQFT).  
    - Evaluated using coefficients, R-squared, and residuals.  

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) - Linear Kernel**:  
    - Linear decision boundary.  
    - Reported number of support vectors.  

- **SVM - Radial Kernel (Optimized)**:  
    - Hyperparameter tuning (gamma and cost) via 5-fold cross-validation.  
    - Selected best parameters for final model.  

**Evaluation Metrics (Compared for All Models)**  
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average absolute prediction error.  
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Squared errors (penalizes large errors).  
- **RMSE (Root MSE)**: Interpretable in original units.  

**Robust Validation**  
- Monte Carlo Cross-Validation (100 iterations) to ensure stability of metrics.  

**Visualization**  
- Plotted all three model predictions against actual data for comparison.  

3. **Key Takeaways**  
- **Best Model**: Likely the Radial SVM (due to its flexibility in capturing non-linear patterns), but metrics determine the final choice.  
- **Why Log Transform?**  
    - Compresses large value ranges (NY housing prices vary widely).  
    - Makes relationships more linear.  
- **Why SVM?**  
    - Effective for non-linear relationships (common in real estate).  
    - Robust to outliers compared to linear regression.  

4. **Output Summary**  
The script provides:  
- Detailed model summaries (coefficients, support vectors, tuning results).  
- Test-set metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE) for all models.  
- Monte Carlo averaged metrics (more reliable).  
- Comparative plot of predictions.  

This approach ensures a comprehensive, reproducible, and statistically sound comparison of regression techniques for predicting housing prices.
